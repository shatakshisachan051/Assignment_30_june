Question 3:
Problem Statement:
Create a small Booking System using Factory Pattern.

Define an interface IBooking with:
book(): string
Create concrete classes:
HotelBooking
FlightBooking
TrainBooking
Each should implement the interface and return a custom string like "Hotel booked at Marriott".

Create a BookingFactory that returns an object of type IBooking based on a string like "hotel", "flight", "train".
Simulate a booking using user input (e.g., const type = "flight").
