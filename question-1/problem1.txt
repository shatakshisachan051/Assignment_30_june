Question 1:
Problem Statement:
Design a User class that holds the following properties:

name (string)
email (string)
role (enum: Admin, Editor, Viewer)
Create an interface IUser with a describe() method that outputs a formatted string like:

Name: John | Email: john@example.com | Role: Admin
Extend this system:

Use interfaces for structure
Use enums for roles
Add a subclass PremiumUser with an extra method activatePremium() that returns "Premium features activated".
